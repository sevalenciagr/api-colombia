#### API - COLOMBIA

This project was created as a solution to a technical test for a front-end developer position. The project was built using React, Typescript, and Bootstrap.

The following API was used for data consumption:

- https://api-colombia.com/
- https://api-colombia.com/swagger/index.html

To start the project, Vite was used with the following command:
`npm create vite@latest`, and Bootstrap was installed as it allowed me to use a guide template and structure the project based on an example.


#### Installation

Run the following command in the terminal:

`npm i`

This will install all the necessary dependencies to run the project locally.

#### Usage

In the terminal, run the command `npm run dev` to open the project locally at

http://localhost:5173/.

Alternatively, the project can also be viewed in its initial version deployed on Vercel at the following link:
